    <p>
      <strong>Limitation:</strong> The web presence is part of the WWW and is therefore linked to external websites that can change at any time, which are consequently not subject to this scope of responsibility and do not apply to the following information.

    <p>
      According to the judgment of May 12, 1998 - 312 O 85/98 - “Liability for Links,” the Hamburg Regional Court decided that by placing a link, you might be partly responsible for the content of the linked site. This can only be prevented by explicitly distancing yourself from these contents. ‘Hereby, we expressly distance ourselves from all contents of all linked sites on our website and do not adopt these contents as our own. This declaration applies to all links placed on our website.’
